		<p>
			Our server found an email address in your form submission. But <strong
				>the submitted address appears to be invalid</strong
			>. If you want a reply from us, we{apos}re gonna need a valid email
			address to which to send our response.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our stubborn server refused to accept an invalid email address.
			<strong>We did not receive your message.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is an automated process: <strong
				>no human has seen your submission yet.</strong
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			Please use your browser{apos}s <strong>back button</strong> to return to
			the <strong>contact form.</strong> Edit your email address, then re-submit
			the form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Or try again later. If it is urgent, then please send an email to <CoderEmail
				domain="scratchcode.academy"
				emailAddress="coder"
				subject={getSubject(metadata.title)}
			/> or try our <a href="/feedback">feedback form</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do email us, then please put <strong
				>{getSubject(metadata.title)}</strong
			> in the subject line.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do want to hear from you, so we hope we can get this straightened out.
			If we have somehow screwed this up or there is something that we could do
			better, then please do let us know. <strong
				>Our sincere thanks for your efforts.</strong
