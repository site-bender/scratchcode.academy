			We got your form submission. But we <strong
				>could not find a message from you</strong
			>. Without a message, we have nothing to which we may respond.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our stubborn server refused to proceed without that message. <strong
				>We did not receive your submission.</strong

		</p>
		<p>
			This is an automated process: <strong
				>no human has seen your submission yet.</strong
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			Please use your browser{apos}s <strong>back button</strong> to return to
			the <strong>contact form.</strong> Then add your message and re-submit the
			form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Or send an email to <CoderEmail
				domain="scratchcode.academy"
				emailAddress="coder"
				subject={getSubject(metadata.title)}
			/> if you believe that you received this message in error. You can also
			use our <a href="/feedback">feedback form</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do email us, then please put <strong
				>{getSubject(metadata.title)}</strong
			> in the subject line.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do want to hear from you, so we hope we can get this straightened out.
			If we have somehow screwed this up or there is something that we could do
			better, then please do let us know. <strong
				>Our sincere thanks for your efforts.</strong
