			We got your form submission. But we were <strong

			>. We need a valid email address to permit us to complete your request to
			join.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our stubborn server refused to proceed without an email address. <strong

		</p>
		<p>
			This is an automated process: <strong

			Please use your browser{apos}s <strong>back button</strong> to return to
			the <strong>join us form.</strong> Then add your email address and
			re-submit the form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Or send an email to <CoderEmail
				domain="scratchcode.academy"
				emailAddress="coder"
				subject={getSubject(metadata.title)}
			/> if you believe that you received this message in error. You can also
			use our <a href="/feedback">feedback form</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do email us, then please put <strong
				>{getSubject(metadata.title)}</strong
			> in the subject line.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do want to hear from you, so we hope we can get this straightened out.
			If we have somehow screwed this up or there is something that we could do
			better, then please do let us know. <strong
				>But please do keep trying.</strong
