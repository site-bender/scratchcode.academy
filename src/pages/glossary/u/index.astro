				<strong>Universal design</strong> is the design of buildings, products
				or environments to make them accessible to people, regardless of age,
				disability or other factors. It addresses common barriers to
				participation by creating things that can be used by the maximum number
				of people possible.
			</dd><dd>
				In recent years, universal design principles have found their way to the


				<a href="/glossary/w#www" rel="glossary">Web</a> where numerous web
				developers have begun to apply them to the design of <a
					href="/glossary/w#web-app"

				A <strong>user agent</strong> is a computer program representing a
				person, for example, a <a href="/glossary/b#browser" rel="glossary"
					>browser</a
				> in a Web context.
			</dd><dd>
				Besides a browser, a user agent could be a <a
					href="/glossary/b#bot"
					rel="glossary">bot</a
				>
				 scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the
				Web. Along with each request they make to the server, browsers include a
				self-identifying User-Agent <a
					href="/glossary/h#http"
					rel="glossary"
					title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</a
				>{" "}
				<a href="/glossary/h#header" rel="glossary">header</a> called a user
				agent (UA) string [of characters]. This string often identifies the
				browser, its version number, and its host operating system.

			<dt id="user-agent-stylesheet"><dfn>user agent stylesheet</dfn></dt><dd>
				A user agent stylesheet is a pre-defined set of <a
					href="/glossary/c#css"
					rel="glossary">CSS</a
				> rules that are built into a web browser and applied to web pages
				automatically. The purpose of the user agent stylesheet is to provide a
				consistent and standardized visual rendering of <a
					href="/glossary/h#html"
					rel="glossary">HTML</a
				> elements across different web pages and websites. The rules in the
				user agent stylesheet define how HTML elements should be displayed by
				default, including things like font size, color, spacing, and alignment.

				<strong>User Experience</strong> (UX) is how a user interacts with and
				experiences a product, system or service. It includes a person ºs
				perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency.
			</dd><dd>
				Improving user experience is important to most companies, designers, and
				creators when creating and refining products because negative user
				experience can diminish the use of the product and, therefore, any
				desired positive impacts; conversely, designing toward profitability
				often conflicts with ethical user experience objectives and even causes
				harm.
			</dd><dd>
				User experience is subjective. However, the attributes that make up the
				user experience are objective.

			</dt><dd>
				<strong>User Interface</strong> (UI) is anything that facilitates the
				interaction between a user and a machine. In the world of computers, it
				can be anything from a keyboard, a joystick, a screen or a program. In
				case of computer software, it can be a command-line prompt, a webpage, a
				user input form, or the front-end of any application.
