				<strong>Return on investment</strong> (ROI) or return on costs (ROC) is
				a ratio between net income (over a period) and investment (costs
				resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time). A
				high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably to its cost. As
				a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an
				investment or to compare the efficiencies of several different
				investments.

				As in financial investing, ROI in <a
