      We got your form submission. But we were <strong

      Our stubborn server refused to proceed without an email address. <strong

      Please use your browser{apos}s <strong>back button</strong> to return to

        emailAddress="coder"
        subject={getSubject(metadata.title)}
      /> if you believe that you received this message in error. You can also
      use our <a href="/feedback">feedback form</a>.

      If you do email us, then please put <strong

    <p>
      We do want to hear from you, so we hope we can get this straightened out.
      If we have somehow screwed this up or there is something that we could do
      better, then please do let us know.
